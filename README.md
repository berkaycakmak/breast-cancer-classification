##Breast cancer classification with KNN, PCA and NCA

### Introduction

In this project, breast cancer classification was made using K-nearest neighbor, PCA and NCA algorithms. The accuracy rate was determined as 95.9% in the K-nearest neighbor algorithm, 92.3% in the PCA algorithm and 99.4% in the NCA algorithm, and the NCA algorithm was chosen as the most successful algorithm.
